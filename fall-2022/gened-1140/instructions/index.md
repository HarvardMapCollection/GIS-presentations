- From your Github Repository, select `Settings`.
- In the left-hand menu under `Code and Automation` select `Pages`.
- Under `Source` select `Branch: main` and choose `Save`.
- The page will now say "Your site is published at" and the link to your site.
> It will take around 5 minutes for your site to become live, and any changes or edits you make to the site may take equally long for the published site to reflect those changes.
